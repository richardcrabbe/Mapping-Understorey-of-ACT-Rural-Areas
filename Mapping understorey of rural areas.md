# Mapping Understorey of Rural Areas in Australian Capital Territory

In this project, grass cover in rural areas of the ACT, Australia was categorised into native/exotic and C3/C4 for efficient management.


## Abstract



## Introduction

The overarching aim of the project is to map the understorey vegetation communities of rural areas in the Australian Capital Territory. The specific objectives include the following:
a, discriminate between exotic, native and native high diversity grassland
b, discriminate between C3 and C4 exotic grasses
c, discriminate between dominant grass species
