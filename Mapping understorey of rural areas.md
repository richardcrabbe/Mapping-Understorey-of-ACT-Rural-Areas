# Mapping Understorey of Rural Areas in Australian Capital Territory

In this project, grass cover in rural areas of the ACT, Australia was categorised into native/exotic and C3/C4 for efficient management.


## Abstract



## Introduction

The overarching aim of the project is to map the understorey vegetation communities of rural areas in the Australian Capital Territory. To this end, the specific objectives include: <br>
a, discriminating between exotic, native and native high diversity grassland <br>
b, discriminating between C3 and C4 exotic grasses <br>
c, discriminating between dominant grass species <br>
d, evaluate the performance of machine learning models explored
