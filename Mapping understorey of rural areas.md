# Mapping Understorey of Rural Areas in Australian Capital Territory

In this project, grass cover in rural areas of the ACT, Australia was categorised into native/exotic and C3/C4 for efficient management.


## Abstract



## Introduction

Grasslands are globally ubiquitous, except Antarctica, making it one of the dominant biomes covering approximately 45% of the Earth's terrestrial ecosystems. While glasslands provide habitats for plants, mammals, birds, and reptiles, it contributes approximately 20% of the global soil carbon stocks. Tropical and subtropical grasslands are found mainly in Africa and Australia. In Australia, grasslands provide a range of ecosystem services, including fodder for livestock, refugia for threatened plant and animal species, and protection of soil. 
The overarching aim of the project is to map the understorey vegetation communities of rural areas in the Australian Capital Territory. To this end, the specific objectives include: <br>
- discriminating between exotic, native and native high diversity grassland <br>

- discriminating between C3 and C4 exotic grasses <br>

- discriminating between dominant grass species <br>

- evaluating the performance of machine learning models explored
